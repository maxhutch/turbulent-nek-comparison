## Description of setup

- Reb=2500
- Lx=50h

## Description of run schedule

- Initialize the simulation from the laminar solution
- From t=0 to 50, run with N=5 and tripping
- Use 3 streamwise tripping locations applied to the four walls in all these locations:
 - z/h=12.5
 - z/h=25
 - z/h = 37.5
- From t=50 to 100 to turn off the tripping, and increase N to 7.
- From t=100 to 150 we run with N=11. 
- After t=150, perform the comparison
